# The Farmer and the Donkey

One day a farmer's donkey fell down into a well.
一天，一个农夫的一头驴掉进了一口深井里。

The animal cried piteously for hours as the farmer tried to figure out what to do.
一连几个小时，这头驴在井里哀号着，而农夫也在盘算着该怎么办。

Finally he decided the animal was old and the well needed to be covered up anyway, it just wasn't worth it to retrieve the donkey.
最终，考虑到这头驴已经老了，救它不值得，况且这口井正好也需要封起来，因此他决定就干脆把驴埋在井里。

He invited all his neighbors to come over and help him.
于是，他请来所有的街坊邻居过来帮他封井。

They all grabbed a shovel and began to shovel dirt into the well.
所有的人都来了，大家手里拿着铁铲，开始把土往井里铲，来填埋这口井。

At first, the donkey realized what was happening and cried horribly.
刚开始，这头驴明白了这个情形后，开始痛哭起来。

Then, to everyone's amazement, he quieted down.
后来，它就没动静了，这让大家感觉甚是奇怪。

A few shovel loads later, the farmer finally looked down the well and was astonished at what he saw.
With every shovel of dirt that hit his back, the donkey was doing something amazing.
铲了几锹土之后，这个农夫开始往井里看，结果让他大为震惊：这头驴会把落在它背上的每铲土都抖掉，然后踩在土上向上登一步。

He would shake it off and take a step up. As the farmer's neighbors continued to shovel dirt on top of the animal, he would shake it off and take a step up.
就这样，随着大家继续铲土，这头驴就继续把土抖掉，然后向上登一步。

Pretty soon, everyone was amazed as the donkey stepped up over the edge of the well and trotted off!
很快，这头老驴越过了井沿，爬了上来，然后快步跑开了！

Life is going to shovel dirt on you, all kinds of dirt.
生活也是如此，它会往你身上撒各种“脏土”。

The trick to getting out of the well is to shake it off and take a step up.
要想从这口井里逃出来，秘诀就是抖落身上的尘土，向上迈进一步。

Each of our troubles is a stepping stone.
每一个困难都是我们成长的垫脚石，只要我们从不停息、永不放弃，我们最终都能走出深井。

We can get out of the deepest wells just by not stopping, never giving up! Shake it off and take a step up!
唯一的办法就是：抖落尘土，向上迈进！
